# COMP-484-Capstone-Project - Rockstar Automata: Evolving Cellular Music
Rhys O'Higgins, Aidan Stekloff, and Issaka Van't Hul 

Research project for Macalester College's "Intro To Artificial Intelligence" capstone course. An investigation into the use of 1d cellular automata to generate music, using a simple measure of dissonance and genetic algorithms to identify ruleset/seed pairs that give rise to pleasant music.
